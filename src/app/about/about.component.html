<p class="text-justify font-italic text-dark"><img src="/assets/image3.jpg" width="100%" height="397px">Graduate programs in industrial management draw on Sloan’s idea and provide engineers with a strategic management education with a focus on production management, marketing, financial management, human resources as well as commercial law – supplemented by corporate governance, corporate social responsibility and sustainability topics. The primary goal is to enable students and professionals to take a holistic approach to industry management.

    Most graduate studies in industrial management are full-time MBA degree programs that, in addition to a preferably engineering bachelor’s degree, also require several years of professional experience. In general, students spend the first year of their degree acquiring both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills needed to practice them. After the second year, students usually seek internships and pursue elective courses, which often go towards a specialization in their master’s thesis.

    Study programs in industrial management are very popular in economies with a high value of manufacturing output, such as the United States and Germany. Especially German research universities incorporate a large number of advanced courses in engineering in their graduate program in industrial management and are, thus, more like M.Eng.- programs. On the other hand, U.S. universities and universities of applied sciences in Germany offer MBA programs in industrial management that follow more the original idea of Sloan and emphasize hands-on application of theory.

    Indian institutes such as National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) Mumbai, offers two year full time residential course PGDIM - Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Management which is equivalent to MBA.</p>
